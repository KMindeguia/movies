## Introduction:
Movies is a collection of a few UI/UX ideas that came up whilst developing an iOS app called [Wattmo](http://appsto.re/gb/Mn3J5.i)
You'll find tableviews, details pages, collection views, cool loading animations and more. (I'll let you explore and dig out what you like/need)

I thought it'd be nice to share some of these ideas. You guys have fun with it!
